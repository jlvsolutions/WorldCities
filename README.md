# WorldCities
Sandboxing ASP.NET Core 6, Angular and SQL.
## Summary
This app processes data from simplemaps.com and presents it to the user in a variety of ways.  The presentation includes maps using Google's embedded maps API.  For those who register, adding and editing features are also presented.  Delete and user management is provided to users assigned the administrator role.
###
Planned features include creating graphical overlays on maps for any added entities as well as access management to those entities.
### Disclaimer
This solution is currently in it's infancy and should be considered a true sandbox at this point.  Advanced patterns and practices are not implemented in all areas where not justified.  Also, some areas may seem light due to .NET Core 6's nice features.
